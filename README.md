### BUGS:

Testing in different devices i started using the console toggle device toolbar, to fix and scale the website for all the different screens. After doing this I realised that the display was all over the place for Iphone. This made me create a specific and new version for mobile. 
For this purpose I downloaded Xcode simulator and served the website via [npm package serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to be able to access remotely through my Iphone.(Incompatibility of bg-attachment fixed with mobile devices).
